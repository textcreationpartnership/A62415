            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Hiſtory was related one day by a young Perſian in company; and it was thought by ſeveral worthy the publiſhing in the French Tongue, ſo that it was reſolved to make an Eſſay how it would take: and as Truth is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more lovely then when ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears all naked; We have indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly avoided all thoſe foreign Ornaments with which ſhe is uſed to be clouded in theſe kind of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; not but that we might add ſeveral likely circumſtances which could not be contradicted: the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity with which all things are
<pb facs="tcp:40648:5"/>tranſacted in the Palaces of the <hi>Sophies</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> might afford a Field large enough to Lye with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity.

We have likewiſe wilfully affected a grave Stile, and altogether dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that they call <hi>the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick.</hi> And we thought it enough to make a decent Connection of all the tranſactions together, and from time to time to make ſome Reflections upon them.</p>

            <head>TACHMAS Prince of PERSIA: AN Hiſtorical Novel.</head>
            <p>THere is nothing ſo dangerous for a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as to ſet too high a value upon his own Merit from his Soveraign; and to acquire to himſelf ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Virtue and Bravery,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40648:6"/>as may give his Prince any um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage of danger: This is a Crime that Policy never pardons; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when Love, that believes it may do any thing, joyns its jealouſie to that of a Throne, in the apprehenſion of a Monarch that wants no power to cruſh his unfortunate Rival.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sophy Chabas,</hi> who was poyſoned by ſome whoſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was never yet found out, left two Sons, whereof the eldeſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Seliman,</hi> immediately ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Father, and fills at this day the Throne of <hi>Perſia.</hi> It is not to be doubted but that Heaven, which deſtined him for the greateſt Monarch of <hi>Aſia,</hi> did adorn him with vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40648:6"/>qualities ſuitable to the Grandeur of ſo great a King; but it ſhould have made his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Tachmas</hi> leſs aimable, and brought him into the World with fewer perfections; ſince in a Subject, all qualities that may ſeem worthy of the Diadem, are as ſo many Allarms in the heart of a Soveraign, and create as many ſecret Enemies againſt him that poſſeſſes them. It is hard to gueſs whether <hi>Tachmas</hi> was more obliged to Nature for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of his Body, or the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of his Mind, ſince both theſe parts of him, ſo far different the one from the other, equally gained him the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all mankind.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:40648:7"/>
            <p>The Stature of his Body wa Noble and diſingaged, his Port Majeſtical, his Geſture grave without affectation, the Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Face bold, his Eyes quick, with a mixture of Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Sweetneſs: he had a freedom and aſſurance in his Speech; and all his actions were very natural; his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was deep and piercing: He was quick-ſighted even in the moſt intricate matters: He was read in the Sciences; a great States-man; his conception of all things was quick and diſcreet; his diſcerning-faculty was Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; his prudence perſpicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: he had a Soul worthy of his blood: his humour was War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40648:7"/>abhorring idleneſs: his Courage lofty; he ſubjugated all his thoughts to the intereſt of his Glory; but would not be dazled with the ſplendour of Greatneſs: he was as temperate in the uſe of Pleaſures, as he was conſtant in ſuffering Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity; he was merciful to the oppreſſed, and kind to all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and, what prov'd his ruine, he was ſuſceptible of Love. The King his Brother had always a jealous Eye over him; but he wanted a pretext to colour his hatred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perſia</hi> was then in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found peace; and this ſweet tranquility gave the Court op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to taſte the pleaſures
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40648:8"/>of Innocent Love.</p>
            <p>Amongſt all the Beauties that adorned that Court, <hi>Negara</hi> was the chief: This Princeſs, as well as <hi>Tachmas,</hi> revived in <hi>Iſpaham</hi> the Accompliſhments and Gallantry of the Ancient <hi>Perſians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She was of the Illuſtrious blood of the <hi>Sophies;</hi> but that was the meaneſt of her quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Nature had adorned her with a thouſand other Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons far more commendable than her Birth. Beſides the Beauty which ſhe poſſeſſed in a ſublime degree, there was ſomething in her Countenance, in her Speech, and in all her Actions, ſo Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it was impoſſible not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40648:8"/>to be ſurprized with it. Her Wit gave a particular grace to all ſhe ſaid: She was in the good eſteem of every body; and what commended her Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation more, and made it to be earneſtly deſired, was the Gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of her Humour, alwayes pleaſant, and free from all that was moroſe or reſerved. She had a great Soul, an abſolute Empire over all her Deſires, excepting thoſe that cauſed her misfortune. She believed a long time, That Ambition was the moſt predominant of her Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but ſhe was undeceived by a cruel Experience, and found there was ſomething elſe that always had poſſeſſed the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40648:9"/>firſt place in her heart.</p>
            <p>We are ſo unequal in our Affections, and ſo unlike our ſelves, that one only object is able to make ſeveral diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent impreſſions upon us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diverſity of the times, and diſpoſitions of our Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Negara</hi> appeared for a long time at Court, before <hi>Tachmas</hi> had any other inclination, than an indifferent eſteem for her: though ſhe was every day in his ſight, and entettained by him, all her Charms could draw no tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute from <hi>Tachma's</hi> heart, but a Civil complaiſance, and that reſpect which he owed to her Sex and Merit. But the fatal
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40648:9"/>moment was come, wherein Love reſolved to ſubjugate this Prince to his Empire, to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him afterwards to the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of Fortune, which made him her Victim. It was upon a day, as he entertained the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs alone in the Appartments of <hi>Begona</hi> the <hi>Sophie's</hi> Mother, where ſhe was bred, and where ſhe paſſed the moſt part of her time, <hi>Tachmas</hi> fancied a more than ordinary briskneſs and fire in the Eyes of <hi>Negara;</hi> her Words more graceful, and her Wit more acute; he felt ſecret motions, which until then had been unknown to him; and his heart ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its diſquiet, by the often
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40648:10"/>changing of his Countenance; his Looks grew paſſionate; his Diſcourſes wild, and interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſighs; and it is not to be wondered, if his Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not ſo divertiſing at that time, ſince he was now no more his own. He leaves <hi>Negara's</hi> company much in diſorder; this ſudden change ſurpriſed him ſo much the more, becauſe he always had enjoyed a great tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of mind; but when he conſidered the object of his Paſſion, with the eyes of a Lover; when he repreſented to himſelf that confuſed and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Idea of Beauties, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and Perfections; he found this his bondage more pleaſing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40648:10"/>to him, than his former indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. He reſolves to declare himſelf to the Princeſs upon the firſt opportunity he ſhould meet with: which happened the next day. Finding her in a Room accompanied with one of <hi>Begona's</hi> ſlaves, (who out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect withdrew) he endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſeveral times to diſcover his paſſion to her; but was hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſtill by a kind of ſecret ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous diffidence which ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the paſſage of his ſpeech; all he could do, was to let his Eyes ſpeak ſome part of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of his heart. When he was returned to his own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, he condemned his fears; and foreſeeing no reaſon
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40648:11"/>that might hinder the Princeſs from giving him a favourable hearing, he took a ſtrong reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution not to let ſlip the next occaſion of diſcovering his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to her; he went therefore the next day to viſit her, and finding her alone, he ſpoke to her after this manner: I come, Madam, to confeſs a fault to you, for which I hope you will eaſily grant me your pardon; which is, That I have lived ſo long without being in love with you; but what I have ſuffered ſince we laſt entertained one another, is ſo ſtrong, and ſo far beyond what all other Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers endure, that the exceſs of my Love ought to repair the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40648:11"/>time of my indifference. I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you neither Crowns nor Scepters; I have no other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to give you but that of my Heart: If a Paſſion that ſhall ever inviolably burn for you, and which ſhall never fix upon any other object, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Liberty, my Blood, or our Laws may give me: If a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance which I ſhall ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to you: If an unblemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Faith may win you, I am ready ſolemnly to ſwear it to you at the foot of our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Tachmas</hi> had not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed much action in the delivery of theſe words, yet the Eloquent language of his Eyes and his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40648:12"/>ſighs, were perſuaſive enough to evince them. It is ſo ſweet a triumph for a Woman to ſee the grandeur of a Prince humbl'd at her feet; and to diſarm with the Charms of her Beauty, a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage that no dangers or perils of War could ſhake; that there is no Vertue ſo auſtere, that would not relent when the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is to preſerve ſuch a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Negara</hi> were deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Blood of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies,</hi> yet ſhe was much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in Quality to <hi>Tachmas.</hi> She was pleaſingly ſurpriſed with the Prince's Diſcourſe, not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray her Joy: ſhe thought it not enough to receive the Prince's
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40648:12"/>offers in the moſt obliging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner imaginable; but ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures him, That ſhe ever had a ſecret tenderneſs for him, which ſhe ſhould have endeavoured long ſince to make him ſenſible of, if the rules of Modeſty and Decency had not hinder'd her: and that ſhe would moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſhut her Eyes to all the Crowns upon Earth, to open them to his Virtues alone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Negara</hi> in that very inſtant believed that her Heart diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her words: and that it was the deſire ſhe had to ſee her ſelf ſuddenly, if not the Queen, at leaſt the firſt Subject of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that drew from her this decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: but ſhe was ignorant
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40648:13"/>of her own thoughts, ſince her Tongue was then the faithful interpreter of them: this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was followed with kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-looks, wherein Love ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with all its Charms.</p>
            <p>We all have a natural bent to believe what we paſſionately deſire: and this blind propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity is no where more impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than in the heart of a Lover: one little favourable word would ſuffice to convince <hi>Tachmas</hi> of the ſincerity of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara</hi>'s Love: inſomuch that he abandon'd himſelf to all the exceſſes of Joy which the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and aſſurance of an approaching felicity can raiſe in the ſoul of a paſſionate Lover.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40648:13"/>To haſten the accompliſhment whereof, he told the Princeſs, as he took his leave of her, That he would go immediately to <hi>Allagolikan</hi> to charge him to acquaint the King his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with this Affair. It was with this precipitancy this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Prince run to his utter ruine, when he hoped to raiſe himſelf to his greateſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Allagolikan</hi> was a man that wholly ſwayed the Heart of <hi>Seliman:</hi> though the Power of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Miniſters be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly limited; and that, to weaken their Authority, thoſe Kings diſtribute the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Affairs into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40648:14"/>hands: Yet this Favourite had ſupriſed the affections of the young <hi>Sophy</hi> with ſo much addreſs, he had inſinuated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into his very ſoul with a Zeal ſo paſſionate, ſuch flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſubmiſſions, that he was the only Ruler and Director of all his Councels: He was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe indued with all the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of a perfect Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier: He was full of diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and his intentions and his words were ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of one accord. He had a ſervile Complacency with all the deſires of his Prince: He patiently bore with all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and indignities; but was above meaſure inſolent
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40648:14"/>to all other people. He was a man of no Faith, ſeldom kept his word with any man. He willingly ſacrificed Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to Treachery, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Virtue the greateſt of Crimes, when it ſtood betwixt him and his Deſigns. His aim was to remove from Court all thoſe whoſe Virtue or Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding might render neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or acceptable there; for he held it for an infallible Maxim, That two Favourites, no more than two Kings, can never ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in one Sphere.</p>
            <p>Although <hi>Tacbmas</hi>'s birth ſeemed to place him above the reach of his Jealouſie; <hi>Alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golikan</hi> was infinitely pleaſed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40648:15"/>to find that the <hi>Sophy</hi> had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſiniſter intentions towards his Brother. He made uſe of all his Craft to maintain him in his wicked inclinations. But there was yet a particular rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that made <hi>Allagolikan</hi> a ſworn Enemy to the Prince.</p>
            <p>This imperious Miniſter had one day ſpoken inſolently to <hi>Tachmas,</hi> whereof he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to his Father <hi>Sophy Chabas,</hi> who confined <hi>Allago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likan</hi> to a ſtreight Priſon, where he continued until <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman</hi> came to the Empire. <hi>Tachmas,</hi> who being naturally Good and Generous, went of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to ſee him in Priſon, to teſtifie how much he was ſorry
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40648:15"/>that he had acquainted his Father with the difference that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened betwixt them, who could never be brought to hear any thing in favour of <hi>Allagolikan</hi> during his life. After the death of <hi>Sophy Chabas, Tachmas</hi> thought it not enough to expreſs his Joy for <hi>Allagolikans</hi> liberty, but honoured him alſo with many other teſtimonies of his Love and Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Allagolikan</hi> anſwered the Prince's Careſſes with the faireſt appearances of gratitude that might be: but following the inclination of the generality of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> He was impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable in his Enmity; he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kept in his heart an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40648:16"/>hatred againſt him; in which <hi>Tachmas</hi> is to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for his want of prudent conduct upon this occaſion, and for having forgotten this Maxime, That Reconciled E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies ought alwayes to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
            <p>This wicked Miniſter, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had Order to acquaint his Majeſty with <hi>Tachmas</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to be permitted to Marry <hi>Negara,</hi> undertook it for no other end but to deſtroy this unfortunate Prince; and to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on his purpoſe, he made uſe of a moſt ſubtil Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: He took his time when the <hi>Sophy</hi> was in a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Humour, in order to his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40648:16"/>Deſign: He Approaches him with his accuſtomed Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and uſual Cringings, and dexterouſly brings on the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Love; and tells the King, That he admired that among ſo many Beauties for whom his Majeſty had ſhewed an inclination, he had never ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice that he had any for <hi>Negara.</hi> He repreſents to him, That beſides the ſpendour of her Birth, ſhe was enriched with ſo many rare Qualities, that ſhe deſerved ſomething more than a cold indifference: That there never did ſhine ſo many Virtues, nor ſo much Wit, in ſo beautiful a Body; that it ſhould ſeem that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40648:17"/>which refuſed to place a Crown upon her Head, had reſerved the Empire of all Hearts as a due Sacrifice to her Eyes alone: That there was none ſo hard and ſtony, that could reſiſt her natural Sweetneſs and Goodneſs: and, That there was none more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy his Love and Tenderneſs, than her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Allagolikan</hi> commended <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara</hi> with ſo much Zeal and Earneſtneſs, that <hi>Seliman</hi> felt a ſtrong Curioſity to take a more attentive view of her, and to have ſome particular Diſcourſe with her: He promiſed his Favourite to follow his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and to try how ſenſible
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40648:17"/>her heart ſhould prove when he ſpoke to her next.</p>
            <p>Sometime, afterwards <hi>Begona</hi> the Kings Mother, who of late had been again received into favour; after ſome diſguſts that had paſſed betwixt them, came into his Chamber to ſee him, followed by <hi>Negara,</hi> as the firſt perſon of the Court, and who always went with her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where: when <hi>Begona</hi> was ready to take her leave of the King; he made a ſign to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara,</hi> to let her know, that he deſired to ſpeak with her in ſecret; He had her unto his Cloſet, where the better to diſguiſe his Deſign: He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains her upon a Subject that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40648:18"/>was very different from what had obliged him to ſtay her; He asked her, as ſhe was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to all <hi>Begona</hi>'s thoughts, Whether ſhe did believe, that all <hi>Begona</hi>'s Reſentments againſt him, were quite vaniſhed out of her mind? and whether he might confide in the outward appearances, of her Love and Careſſes?</p>
            <p>Whether it was that <hi>Seliman</hi> was prepoſſeſs'd by his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites Diſcourſes; or that it was a pure effect of <hi>Negara</hi>'s Charms, which he had but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially conſider'd before that time; beſides the agreeable ſurpriſes the Princeſs's Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cauſed in him; all her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40648:18"/>ſeemed to him ſo juſt, and ſo expreſſive, and ſo full of Wit, that ſhe left him Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and even angry with himſelf that he had not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her ſooner; He left her however without ſaying any thing to her; and becauſe he would not derogate from the pride of his Diadem, he choſe to ſend her the tender of his Heart by another hand.</p>
            <p>An Eunuch had order to wait upon her, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her with the Love the King had conceived for her: He told her, the Kings paſſion was attended with ſo much reſpect, and eſteem for her, that he would not only place
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40648:19"/>her the higheſt in his favours, but that he would beſtow upon her the title of Queen; in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of which he would plight her his Faith before the Altars of his gods.</p>
            <p>The differences of Rank and Blood is wonderful: and there is little leſs diſtance betwixt a King and his firſt Subject, than betwixt ſomething and nothing. <hi>Negara</hi> before this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture, would have thought her ſelf highly Honoured to be in the Arms of <hi>Tachmas;</hi> and as ſhe durſt not carry her Ambition higher, ſhe looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Prince as upon an Object whoſe enjoyment was great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to fill all the Deſires
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40648:19"/>of her Soul. But aſſoon as ſhe had been informed of the <hi>Sophies</hi> favourable intentions towards her, the glorious Hopes of ſeeing her ſelf placed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Perſian</hi> Throne, ſo fill'd this young Heart with vanity, that ſhe forgot, or at leaſt believ'd ſhe had, all thoughts of <hi>Tachmas:</hi> that pompous and dazling Image of all-ruling Power, made her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſwallow up the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and all that granduer which ſhe admired in her firſt Lover, appeared to her then but like a ſhadow, or ſome faint glimmerings, which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed their light from the Diadem. She had ſo little
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40648:20"/>power over her ſelf, that ſhe could not conceal her Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports from the Eunuch; ſhe tells him with an affected Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, more becoming a Slave than a Princeſs, That if what he had told her was true, that ſhe had gained favour with the <hi>Sophy,</hi> ſhe would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all his Orders with all the Submiſſions, and Joy ſhe could expreſs.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Tachmas</hi> deſires to know of <hi>Allagoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan,</hi> whether he had acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he gave him? He replies, That he had not yet found a fit opportunity of doing it; but that he would watch the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40648:20"/>firſt occaſion to perform it. This Traytor that ſought to involve this poor Prince into an inextricable deſtruction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afraid that he might ſtifle his paſſion as ſoon as he ſhould hear of his Brothers preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, begun to him a long Diſcourſe of <hi>Negara</hi>'s Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies: Applauds <hi>Tachmas</hi>'s Choice, and tells him, That if he were a Prince born, he ſhould conſecrate all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his life to ſo fair an Object: Nothing ſo feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly touches a Lover as to hear what he loves praiſed by the mouth of a Stranger; nor nothing more convincingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades him that his Love is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40648:21"/>grounded upon Reaſon. All <hi>Allagolikans</hi> words were as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Arrows that made freſh wounds in the heart of poor <hi>Tachmas,</hi> and wounded ſo much the deeper, becauſe this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe proceeded from a man in appearance altogether diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſſed.</p>
            <p>The Prince having recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to this pernicious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident to ſpeak to the King as ſoon as he might, goes to viſit <hi>Negara.</hi> He tells her, That he came from <hi>Allagolikan,</hi> who had yet no opporunity to ſpeak to the <hi>Sophy;</hi> but if that within two days he had no Anſwer, he would paſs by all Formalities, and go him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40648:21"/>to ſpeak to his Brother; and that his impatience was ſo much the greater, becauſe he was ſure the Vows of this Princeſs agreed with his own.</p>
            <p>We ſtrive in vain to reſiſt our ſelves, and endeavour to oppoſe the bent of Nature, which is ſo powerfully attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in us: when the Heavens have given our affection a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity to any one Paſſion, all the reſt are not powerful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to draw us from it: All the faculties of <hi>Negara</hi>'s Soul were in diſtraction at <hi>Tachmas</hi>'s ſight and Diſcourſe: Her Ambition to no purpoſe ſhews her the Charms of a Throne; and tells her, This
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40648:22"/>tenderneſs which began to make a revolt in her heart, was but a ſhameful weakneſs, which ſhe ought to ſtifle and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to her Glory: The Empire has no more that luſtre, when ſhe conſiders ſhe cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to it but at the price of her Faith; the deſpair into which ſhe ſaw her inconſtancy muſt throw this poor Lover, touched her with pity, and repentance, to have ſo raſhly precipitated her Reſolution in declaring ſo inconſiderately in favour of the <hi>Sophy.</hi> Love at that inſtant diſpelling with his flambeau the beams of Supream Majeſty, left her nothing now to ſee but the Thorns that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40648:22"/>the Crown; and for a ſolid Good, ſhe ſees nothing but a Phantaſm, and a vain il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion. All thoſe tumultuary inſults of Pride, Ambition, and Vanity, vaniſh out of the heart, with the ſame promptneſs they had been raiſed. The Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all the Excellencies that were in <hi>Tachmas,</hi> offers it ſelf with more endearing luſter than ever; and as the Virtues appear unto us quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in thoſe we love, than in thoſe who are indifferent to us; Thoſe which were common to them both, ſeemed in <hi>Tach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> a glorious Body, of which the <hi>Sophy</hi> poſſeſſed but the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. She was a long time
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40648:23"/>without being able to make any other anſwer than by her ſighs: but as he preſſed her with much impatience to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him of the cauſes of her ſadneſs; She related to him what the Eunuch came to tell her from the King. <hi>Tachmas</hi> at this news, as if he had been Planet-ſtruck, ſtood like a Statue; As ſoon as he recover'd himſelf, he reſolved to run tranſported as he was, back to this perfidious Miniſter, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him for his Treachery: But <hi>Negara</hi> foreſeeing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he was going unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to expoſe himſelf to, threw her ſelf in his way, and with the Eloquence of her
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40648:23"/>ſighs and tears, allay'd the heat of his fury.</p>
            <p>The Princeſs being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of <hi>Allagobikan</hi>'s bad incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations towards <hi>Tachmas,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to juſtifie him; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, That perhaps this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite might know nothing of the Kings paſſion, or that he had not concealed it from <hi>Tachmas,</hi> but out of a juſt apprehenſion to hurry him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome raſh undertaking, that might be of very funeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequence; That taking the proceedings in the ſtriccteſt ſenſe, he could be accuſed of nothing but too much Zeal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, by deſiring to ſee her upon the Throne. She
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40648:24"/>added, That it was prudence, carefully to conceal their Love from the <hi>Sophy:</hi> That it was neceſſary he ſhould go imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to <hi>Allagolikan,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to keep their ſecret, and to engage him by all manner of Endearments to make him employ all his Credit, and Addreſs to draw the <hi>Sophy</hi> from his Deſign: That <hi>Seli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Love might happily be but a ſlight Flame, which might be as quickly ſmother'd as it was kindled: That ſhe would avoid his ſight as much as it was poſſible for her; and that nothing but force ſhould ever trample over her conſtancy, and fidelity to him.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:40648:24"/>
            <p>There is no Paſſion predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in mans Soul, that ſo often makes Storms and Calms ſucced one another in us, and agitates our minds with ſo many contrary motions, as Love. <hi>Tachmas,</hi> who before this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was all Fury and Rage againſt <hi>Allagolikan,</hi> is now of a ſudden all Love and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards him: and his Bad Genius utterly blinding his Reaſon, had now as favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thoughts of his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the Princeſs had. He goes to him, and by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, which nothing but Love could excuſe in a Prince ſo Judicious; He furniſhes him with Reaſons to excuſe his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40648:25"/>Treachery. He told him, He very well knew that he had not concealed the <hi>Sophies</hi> Love from him, but through his exceſs of Zeal towards him; and that he entreated him for the future, to give him a faiht<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful account of what ſhould happen, by which only means he ſhould be convinced of his fidelity to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Allagolikan,</hi> after a thouſand frivolous proteſtations, ſwears by the Heavens, and all that was Sacred and Holy, that he would not fail to give him a true Account, of whatever came to his knowledg with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay. As he was endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a piercing Wit, he
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40648:25"/>quickly found that this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Lover had let his flame encreaſe to that degree, that there was no poſſibility for him ever to be able to quench it. He thought it to purpoſe to embroil him with <hi>Negara,</hi> to inſpire him with ſo much the more hatred againſt his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe he endeavoured to rob him of his Princeſs's Heart, as well as of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of her Perſon. Feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſudden to repent him of his Oaths and Promiſes, lets <hi>Tachmas</hi> know, That he had a ſecret of Importance, which he ſhould be glad not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to declare; but after ſhifting for a long time the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40648:26"/>Prince's importunity, to raiſe in him a greater deſire of knowing it; at laſt told him, That <hi>Negara</hi>'s inconſtancy ought as much to be apprehended as <hi>Seliman</hi>'s Love; That he had been certainly informed, that ſhe received the news of the King's paſſion with ſo much Joy, and ſhewed ſo much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to comply with his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, that he did not doubt but the luſtre of the Diadem had dazled her Eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tachmas</hi> returns preſently to the Princeſs all diſtracted; tells her the cauſe of his ſighs, and the occaſion of his Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie. <hi>Negara,</hi> that naturally loved ſincerity, ingenuouſly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40648:26"/>confeſſes to him, That when the <hi>Sophy</hi> had ſent her a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his Love, ſhe had received it favourably in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of what he was; and ſhe regarded more his Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than his Perſon; ſo that when an Eunuch came to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her with the Hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Sophie</hi>'s Queen, ſhe ſtill followed the impulſe of her Ambition; and ſhe could not defend her ſelf from the attractive Charms of a Throne; but that the preſence of <hi>Tach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> had in a moments time diſſipated all that Ambitious pride; and that thoſe Tears ſhe had ſhed, and thoſe ſighs which ſtole from her when
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40648:27"/>ſhe ſaw him enter, ought not to be attributed to any thing elſe, but the regret ſhe had for ſhewing the Eunuch her Joy, and her ſubmiſſion to the King's Order. That ſince he left her, her Ambition ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to rebel againſt her Love, ſhe had ſuffered all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts that thoſe two Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Tyrannical paſſions can raiſe in a Soul. That her Heart, after being rent by their Cruel inſults, and divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two Objects, had at laſt ſtifled all the Flames of Ambition, with intent for ever after to feed thoſe of Love only. That now ſhe began to acknowledg the truth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40648:27"/>of the firſt words ſhe had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to him; which were, That ſhe would ſhut her Eyes to all the Crowns of the Earth, to open them to his Virtues. That he needed no other tryal of her Love, than that ſincere Confeſſion ſhe had made him, which was the greateſt proof ſhe could give him of it. And that ſhe did call the Holy Prophet to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, That neither the offers of the Throne, nor the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of the <hi>Sophy,</hi> ſhould ever be able to overthrow that Empire which <hi>Tachmas</hi> had acquired over her Heart.</p>
            <p>Though theſe Diſcourſes and others might re-aſſure the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40648:28"/>Prince; Yet he could not wholly ſuppreſs his Jealouſie; for he judged, That as <hi>Negara</hi> had eloped from Ambition to Love, ſhe might with the ſame eaſineſs return from Love to Ambition.</p>
            <p>At that very inſtant <hi>Seli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> whom <hi>Allagolikan</hi> had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with what paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Tachmas</hi> and him, came ruſhing into the Chamber, and commanded <hi>Tachmas</hi> to go out; after forbidding him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of Death never to ſee, nor ſpeak more to the Princeſs, whom he deſigned for his own Bed. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached her with the want of affection for him; telling
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40648:28"/>her, It was an odd way of deſerving the Honour he was going to do her, by ſuffering any other to entertain her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf: That all the Beauties of <hi>Perſia</hi> would moſt earneſtly wiſh, not only for the Rank he intended for her, but even for the leaſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar favour of their King: That ſhe deſerved to be uſed like the meaneſt of his Slaves, were it not for the reſpect he had for her Blood. He was not ſatisfied to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden her for ever the ſight of her Lover, but commands an Eunuch to wait cloſe in her Chamber, to ſpy all her actions, and to give him a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40648:29"/>faithful account of them. He told her, as he was going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from her, That ſhe ſhould prepare her ſelf to receive his Faith the next morning.</p>
            <p>Whatever has been ſaid of the ſtrength of our mind, it muſt be allow'd, that all its facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are very weak, ſince they are not able to ſupport the violence of our paſſions: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Grief, and exceſs of Joy, make us inſenſible as Statues: they muſt abate of their force, to make us ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of them. The <hi>Sophies</hi> Diſcourſe left <hi>Negara</hi> without ſenſe or motion; and ſhe was a long while before ſhe could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her ſelf, or conſider the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40648:29"/>ſtate ſhe was reduced to. When ſhe came to her ſelf, and was able to open her Eyes, ſhe could ſee nothing but an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſs of Miſeries. As our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires commonly encreaſe by Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, and are irritated ſo much the more, by how much the poſſeſſion of their Object is difficult: ſo the Princeſs felt her Love to <hi>Tachmas</hi> grow ſo much the greater, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion ſhe made, that ſhe was going eternally to loſe him. The Minutes ſeemed to flye fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and the Sun to precipitate his courſe, to advance that fatal hour, which was to deliver her a Victim to the <hi>Sophies</hi> will. In vain ſhe look't a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40648:30"/>her for Relief; ſhe could find nothing that could eaſe her grief. The very liberty of complaining was forbidden her: ſhe durſt not ſo much as let fall a tear, nor breathe out a ſigh, leſt if the <hi>Sophy</hi> ſhould know it, he ſhould pour down all his vengeance upon her Lovers Head.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Tachmas</hi> being inſtructed by <hi>Allagoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan,</hi> of <hi>Seliman</hi>'s Reſolution, was no leſs perplexed. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever project this great Soul could ſet on foot, he ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhut up in a Palace full of Eunuches and barbarous Slaves, all devoted to the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies</hi> Will; all his hopes reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40648:30"/>in <hi>Allagolikan;</hi> it was from him alone he expected ſome ſolace in his Deſpair.</p>
            <p>Knowing then that he was all powerful in the Palace; He entreats him to facilitate his Acceſs once more to the Princeſs, before that fatal hour, wherein he was for ever to be baniſhed from her ſight. <hi>Allagolikan</hi> oppoſed him for a great while, repreſenting to him the impoſſibility, and the hazard of what he deſired; That the Diſcovery would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe both theirs, as well as <hi>Negara</hi>'s life, to inextricable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>At laſt, ſeeing himſelf more and more preſſed by <hi>Tachmas,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:40648:31"/>he ſeemed to yield to his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: and told him, If any miſchief followed, he ſhould in no ways attribute it to him. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the Prince, That he was going to give Order to a truſty Slave, to come to give them ſudden notice if the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> were coming out; but it was indeed to let the <hi>Sophy</hi> know, that the Eunuch whom he left in <hi>Negara</hi>'s Chamber, was corrupted. <hi>Allagolikan</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, and leads him to ſpeak to another Eunuch that was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him that watched in the Princeſs's Chamber: The Prince followed him, and the door was opened as ſoon as the Eunuch made his voice be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40648:31"/>heard. <hi>Negara</hi> was not a little ſurpriſed to ſee the Prince once more; Love, Fear, Joy and Grief confuſedly agitate her Soul. Theſe ill-Starr'd Lovers ſcarce had time to mingle tears, and to inform one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their mutual tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by their paſſionate looks, when of a ſudden they heard a great noiſe of many people coming haſtily that way: the Eunuch all in confuſion run to a back-door that opened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Begona</hi>'s Appartments, to let the Prince ſlip out that way: but was furiouſly puſhed back by the <hi>Sophy</hi> himſelf that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred that way, and cauſed him immediatel to be run
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40648:32"/>through by another Eunuch that ruſhed in at the other door, without giving the poor wretch the time to juſtifie himſelf. He Commands them likewiſe to ſtrangle <hi>Tachmas;</hi> who heard this Cruel ſentence without the leaſt concern; and who would have made them ſenſible of a more undaunted Courage, if a man that is paſſionately in Love, could reſolve to dye without regret.</p>
            <p>The Princeſs hearing this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Command, threw her ſelf proſtrate at <hi>Seliman</hi>'s feet, and with her tears and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cryes ſtopped, or at leaſt ſuſpended the execution of this ſevere Order, which thoſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40648:32"/>Eunuchs were upon the point of executing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Begona</hi> at the ſame inſtant came running in, and would have joyned her ſupplications with <hi>Negara</hi>'s: but the <hi>Sophy,</hi> who had always obſerved, that ſhe had a more tender affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for <hi>Tachmas,</hi> than for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which had been indeed the cauſe of their falling out; believed that ſhe was of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would not hear her. He did not then puſh matters to the extremity: but gave all ſufficiently to underſtand, by the ſeverity of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, by the flaming of his Eyes, all full of fury, and by
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40648:33"/>the often ſhaking of his Head, that the puniſhment he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to inflict upon theſe Lovers, was but defer'd. He cauſed <hi>Tachmas</hi> to be clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into a dark Dungeon: and placed at <hi>Negara</hi>'s door, thoſe of his Eunuchs in whom he moſt confided, with ſtrict Order to let no Soul enter, upon pain of falling into the ſame diſgrace with their dead Companion; and ſo goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: and ſhutting himſelf with <hi>Allagolikan</hi> into a Cloſet, tells him what happen'd, and asked his opinion of what ſhould be done to <hi>Tachmas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Allagolikan</hi> ſhewed a feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tenderneſs, that he might
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40648:33"/>ſtrike his blow home: told <hi>Seliman,</hi> That the Laws of Nature would never permit him to uſe the rigour of his Juſtice in this rencounter. But the <hi>Sophy</hi> preſſed him to deliver his opinion without reſpect or regard to perſons: and told him, That the Throne was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the tyes of Blood: and that Nature muſt be ſilent, where the intereſt of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign was in queſtion.</p>
            <p>This perjured Traytor here, calling Heaven, and their holy Prophets to witneſs, That he was going to declare his ſenſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preoccupation, or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to one ſide or other; repreſents to <hi>Seliman,</hi> That it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40648:34"/>was of the laſt importance to him, not to let <hi>Tachmas</hi> his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence go unpuniſhed. That the leaſt Revolt in a Subject againſt the will of his Prince, deſerved Death: That as the paſſion which <hi>Tachmas</hi> had for <hi>Negara,</hi> could never be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, ſo he would never leave trying all ways poſſible to ſatisfie it: That <hi>Tachmas</hi> was of a daring Spirit, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of undertaking any thing: That he might ſeek his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Death, as the beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to ſet the Crown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Head, and ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring his Miſtreſs into his Embraces: That the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not difficult: That
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40648:34"/>having already ſeduced one Eunuch, he might do the like to many more: That perhaps <hi>Tachmas</hi> came to <hi>Negara</hi> for no other end, but to concert the Deſign how he might rid himſelf of his Brother: That the example of the <hi>Sophy Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> yet freſh in memory, ought to ſtrike a terrour into him, and make him ſacrifice to his own ſecurity all that was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to him. That he ought to look towards his Neighbors the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> whoſe cuſtom it was to Ciment their Thrones with the blood of their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>This venomous Diſcourſe of <hi>Allagolikan,</hi> had too ſtrong an
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40648:35"/>impreſſion upon a Heart that was already too prone to ſuch barbarous inclinations. <hi>Seli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> tells his Favourite, All he ſaid was very juſt: and that he was reſolved to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Advice. He added, That although the Wills of the <hi>Sophy</hi>'s had always been a Soveraign Law to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; he was reſolved, the better to avoid the peoples murmuring, not to rid himſelf of his Brother, without keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome formality in putting him to death: and to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then this Reſolution, with the opinion and aſſent of ſome Judges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Allagolikan</hi> did not oppoſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40648:35"/>the King's Will, becauſe he knew there were but too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corrupted perſons to be found in the Court: He makes choice of Six, who with a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and blind Zeal, had ſold their Souls, and condemned poor <hi>Tachmas</hi> as <hi>Siliman</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The noiſe of this fatal Sentence was ſoon ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Palace: and ſome months after, all the Town of <hi>Iſpaham</hi> heard, that the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Tachmas</hi> was to be put to death by the hands of the Executioner, for ſome ſecret and important Reaſons.</p>
            <p>A Scaffold for this Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was erected in one of the great Halls of the Palace,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40648:36"/>where the <hi>Sophy</hi> himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be, to feed his cruel Eyes with this ſo Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal a Spectacle. <hi>Allagolikan</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a great while this Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, fearing what afterwards happen'd; but all his Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances to the contrary, did but irritate his Deſires the more. The Queen <hi>Begona</hi> run to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman</hi>'s Door, to conjure him by that life ſhe gave him, not to ſully his Glory with ſo baſe a Parricide; but he was ſo far from letting her in, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Eunuchs to ſhut her up, fearing her lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and cryes might ſoften his heart, or bring it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. The time of this black
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40648:36"/>Sacrifice being come, they led forth <hi>Tachmas</hi> out of his Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, to expiate the Crime of his Love and ill-policy. How ſtrong is the voice of Nature in mans heart? How difficult a matter is it to lay aſide all ſenſe? How powerfully does the preſence of a ſad Object move us?</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Sophy</hi> beheld his Brother loaden with Chains, his Eyes languiſhing, his Face pale and disfigur'd; not for fear of Death, but through the violence of his paſſionate Love: It was too late to call back all his hatred and Jealouſie; there was no reſiſting of that melting tenderneſs with which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40648:37"/>he felt himſelf ſuddenly ſeized; and if he had any malice left in him againſt <hi>Tachmas,</hi> it was becauſe he found him too innocent. He ſuſpends the Execution, and orders the Prince to be confined to a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Priſon, where he might have more Light and Ayr. The major part of the Judges there preſent were not ſorry for this ſudden Change, becauſe they had no hand in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given againſt the Prince. But <hi>Allagolikan</hi> was ſo nearly touch'd, that his diſpleaſure was ſeen in his Countenance; <hi>Tachmas</hi> perceived it, for his Eyes, that hitherto had been darkened with the Clouds of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40648:37"/>Love and Friendſhip, let fall that miſt, to ſhew him a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor that had ſworn his Ruine, in the man he believed his moſt faithful Friend. And one of the Eunuchs that waited upon him back to priſon, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſentence of Death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, helped fully to diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe him, thereby hoping to gain his affection; and told him, That it was <hi>Allagolikan</hi>'s advice that hurried the <hi>Sophy</hi> to this Extremity.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Negara</hi>'s heart was rent with many mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Diſquiets: ſhe was toſſed betwixt a thouſand apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and gave her ſelf over as a prey to all the vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40648:38"/>that could perplex a Soul. Death repreſents many violent expedient to her troubled I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination, whereby to free her ſelf from this Abyſs of Miſery, into which ſhe ſaw her ſelf plunged; but ſhe durſt not diſpoſe of her ſelf without knowing <hi>Tachmas</hi> fate. So true it is, that amongſt ſincere Lovers, the intereſt of what they love, is dearer to them than their own. She draws one of the Eunuchs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide: and preſſing him to let her know what he heard was become of the Prince, ſhows him a Diamond of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, which ſhe wore upon her Finger; which ſhe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40648:38"/>ſhould be the reward of his Service. This man, won partly by the hope of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and partly ſoftened with the fight of the Princeſſes miſeries, reſolved to betray his truſt for this one time; as he did believe he ſhould give ſome eaſe to <hi>Negara</hi>'s af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Soul, if he drew her out of the uncertainty ſhe then was in: He confeſſed to her, That <hi>Tachmas</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to loſe his Head up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Scaffold, and that, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that was the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Execution.</p>
            <p>We have naturally a great Averſion, and Horror for any thing that torments us: and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40648:39"/>we bear all our grievances with ſo much impatience, that we always fancy them in the laſt extremity, and that no new Event is capable of adding to them: but we are not long in this Errour; for Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence often convinces us of the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Negara</hi> believed ſhe ſhould ſuffer leſs by knowing <hi>Tach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>'s doom; but ſhe ſoon was convinced, that her doubts were preferable to ſo diſmal a knowledg: When ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to her ſelf thoſe terrifying Idea's of his murder; She fancied ſhe ſaw the Prince all cover'd with blood; and that Face, and thoſe Eyes,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40648:39"/>wherein ſhe had been ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten pleaſed to read the marks of a ſincere and paſſionate Love, now buried in an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Night; ſhe could no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſupport the weight of her ſorrow. But as ſhe had yet ſo much ſenſe left, to think, that perhaps there was yet time enough to reſcue her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Lover; She conjures the Eunuch to run and tell the King, That ſhe had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of great moment to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to him before he ſhould carry <hi>Tachmas</hi> to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The Eunuch could not be won by any promiſe to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie her Requeſt, knowing his Head would be the price
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40648:40"/>of his Complaiſance. So that <hi>Negara</hi> was forced to addreſs her ſelf to another, from whom ſhe concealed her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of <hi>Tachmas</hi>'s Doom; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prays him to acquaint the King, that ſhe deſired to ſpeak with him. <hi>Seliman</hi> at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time would have cauſed all the Eunuchs that were in <hi>Negara</hi>'s Chamber to be put to death, becauſe he ſtrictly charged them to conceal from her thoſe violent Reſolutions he had taken againſt his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But the emotions which his Brothers preſence had raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Soul, would not ſuffer him to reflect upon the breach of his Commands.</p>
            <pb n="71" facs="tcp:40648:40"/>
            <p>As ſoon as the Princeſs ſaw him enter into the Chamber, ſhe threw her ſelf at his feet: and told him, That his own intereſt muſt perſwade him to let <hi>Tachmas</hi> live; That ſhe would not now ſpeak of the Seditions and Revolts that might be ſtirred up amongſt a people, that would not quietly bear the loſs of a Prince that was ſo dear to them, condemned upon the ſuggeſtion of an imaginary Crime. That Hiſtory was full of Examples of theſe kind of Diſorders, raiſed upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions: But, laying aſide all theſe conſiderations: If it were true, that he had any kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40648:41"/>for her, he ought to grant her this favour; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, ſhe promiſed for ever to bury all thoughts of that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhe formerly had for <hi>Tachmas;</hi> and to anſwer all his deſigns with ſo perfect an obedience and intire reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he ſhould even doubt whether ever ſhe had ſetled her inclinations upon any other but himſelf: but, that if he would puſh his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour againſt his Brother to the utmoſt extremity, ſhe durſt not promiſe him that ſhe ſhould have ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over her ſelf, as not to hate mortally that man, who all cover'd over with the blood
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40648:41"/>of him ſhe had once loved, ſhould force her to marry him, to make her againſt her will a Complice to his Crime.</p>
            <p>The Princeſs found little difficulty in obtaining her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Seliman;</hi> and Love happily concluded what Nature had begun. But as the <hi>Sophy</hi> was infinitely Jealous, he told <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> That though he had granted her <hi>Tachmas</hi> his life, it ſhould be upon thoſe Terms ſhe her ſelf propoſed: that is, Upon condition She ſhould for ever ſmother all thoughts of Love or Tenderneſs towards him; and that the leaſt Sigh that ſhould eſcape from her, ſhould be the infallible and irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40648:42"/>decree of his Death. That ſhe had his Doom in her hands: That ſhe muſt look well to her hits, and take her meaſures, ſo as ſhe deſired he ſhould live or die. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That he gave her Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days to conquer this her Paſſion: and to facilitate her victory over her Love, ſhe ſhould ſee <hi>Tachmas</hi> no more; becauſe he well knew how forcible the preſence of the once beloved Object, was to re-inflame a Love that had been quite extinct.</p>
            <p>After this Diſcourſe he left her; and cauſing his Brother to be brought before him, he commanded his Chains to be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40648:42"/>taken off, and outwardly made a ſhew as if he had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reconciled to him: though in his Heart he nouriſhed ſtill a ſecret Jealouſie of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tachmas</hi> now was reſtored to his priſtine Liberty, and was forbidden nothing but the ſight of <hi>Negara.</hi> In the interim, <hi>Allagolikan</hi> knowing that <hi>Tach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> well underſtood the hatred he bore him, doubted not but he would ſtudy a Revenge: Wherefore he reſolves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare open War againſt him, and to ſuggeſt new Crimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him to the <hi>Sophy,</hi> to ruine him: And to make his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation leſs ſuſpected, He contrived to make <hi>Negara</hi> the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40648:43"/>Inſtrument of it, and to make this unfortunate Princeſs the chief promoter of her Lovers Death. Therefore he found out an Invention that had but too Tragical a ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>There was a She-ſlave in the Princeſs <hi>Begona</hi>'s Retinue, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sunamire,</hi> one of the beſt accompliſhed Women in all the Court, excepting <hi>Negara:</hi> ſhe was tranſcendently beautiful, and ſhe had a vivacity of Wit, ſurpaſſing her Beauty. As <hi>Tachmas</hi> loved the converſation of thoſe ſparkling Beauties, he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made his Addreſſes to <hi>Sunamire,</hi> as well as to <hi>Negara,</hi> with much aſſiduity.</p>
            <p>This Ambitious Slave had
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40648:43"/>made ſuch uſe of it, that ſhe imagined, with a little Addreſs, the Prince in ſome ſhort time might infallibly become her Conqueſt. But though ſhe made uſe of all the little neceſſary Arts for her purpoſe, by ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing the Prince's tenderneſs by her repeated ſighs; whether <hi>Tachmas</hi> not yet well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the intrigues of Love, did not underſtand them; or that he did purpoſely deſpiſe them; he returned nothing but indifference: And the gay hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of <hi>Sunamire</hi> was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing that drew him to her converſation. But when ſhe ſaw that after being ſo long blind to her Careſſes, he had
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40648:44"/>ſettled his Affections upon <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara,</hi> ſhe abandon'd her ſelf to all ſorts of Reſentments; and by a change which is very common in the hearts of that Sex, ſhe let the deſire of Revenge ſucceed her Love, in the moſt violent manner ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. She conceived a moſt malignant Joy, when ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that thoſe Lovers were croſſed in their Deſigns, when they believed themſelves upon the point of perfecting their happineſs. However, as it is very hard to wiſh the utter ruine of what we once loved, when we ſee them upon the brink of the precipice; our firſt flames which we thought
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40648:44"/>extinguiſhed, eaſily take fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in their favour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt thoſe motives of hatred which did animate our vengeance. As ſoon as <hi>Suna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire</hi> heard that <hi>Tachmas</hi> was in danger of his life, ſhe uſed all her endeavours for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery; without taking notice that in ſo doing, ſhe diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her paſſion to her Rival. She conjured <hi>Negara</hi> with tears in her Eyes (who was but too well inclined of her ſelf), to make uſe of all her power and intereſt with the <hi>Sophy</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the ſtorm that threatned <hi>Tachmas</hi>'s life.</p>
            <p>This Prince, ſince his being reconciled to his Brother, as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40648:45"/>was ſaid, was no more at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſee <hi>Negara:</hi> not but that he had the freedom to come into the inner part of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; but the Princeſs was locked up in a little particular Appartment, whither none but <hi>Seliman, Begona, Sunamire,</hi> ſome Slaves, and a few Eunuchs, could have ingreſs. <hi>Tachmas</hi> came often to viſit <hi>Sunamire;</hi> but it was only to entertain her with talking of <hi>Negara,</hi> to expreſs to her by the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſenſible Requeſts he could, the greatneſs of his Paſſion for that Princeſs; and the deſpair he was like to fall into, as ſoon as he ſhould know that <hi>Seliman</hi> were poſſeſſed of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40648:45"/>her. <hi>Sunamire</hi> was upon the Rack to hear every day a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe that pierced her very Soul; but ſhe had ſtill ſo much power over her inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to conceal her Jealouſie from the Prince. She dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly eluded all the Queſtions that <hi>Tachmas</hi> asked about the diſpoſition of <hi>Negara</hi>'s mind; or when ſhe found her ſelf hard preſſed, ſhe would tell him, That <hi>Negara</hi> had reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſatisfie the <hi>Sophy</hi> in all his Deſires, ſince ſhe had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe left in her Choice. She adviſed him for his part to take other meaſures, ſince there were in <hi>Iſpaham,</hi> and within the Court it ſelf, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40648:46"/>no way inferiour to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara,</hi> either in Beauty or Wit, that would count it their chiefeſt Glory to poſſeſs <hi>Tach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>'s Heart. The Prince, that too well underſtood the drift of theſe Diſcourſes ſo often reiterated, had much ado to endure them. At laſt one day, being no longer able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf, told <hi>Sunamire,</hi> That he ſaw well enough what ſhe would be at: That he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways believed his ſilence had been enough to quell her aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring thoughts to let her know his mind: but that ſince ſhe forced him to explain himſelf, he gave her to underſtand, That his Viſits to her were but
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40648:46"/>to receive the conſolation from her, of hearing ſome news of his Princeſs, and not to wrong her by ſo baſe an inconſtancy: and he ſhould always hold them for his greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that ſhould adviſe him to ſuch an infidelity. After theſe words he withdrew, and left her full of ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
            <p>It was then that this fierce Slave ſmothered for ever all the flames of Love, to kindle thoſe of Fury and Revenge; and armed her ſelf with all that hatred and ſpight could ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to ruine <hi>Tachmas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Allagolikan</hi> knew all that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed within the inner part of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40648:47"/>the Palace, by the intelligence he kept with ſome of the Eunuchs, whom he won with Rewards for that purpoſe; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, one called <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardaout,</hi> in whom he put an intire confidence, and to whom he uſed to impart all his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets. This <hi>Metardaout</hi> was a witty man, a Diſſembler; and his Genius much like to that of <hi>Allagolikan,</hi> and had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ſeveral other Eunuchs; being very officious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant, he had gained the good opinion of the Ladies. <hi>Sunamire</hi> above all other, gave him marks of her kindneſs, and ſuffer'd him freely to diſcourſe with her.</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:40648:47"/>
            <p>This Eunuch had heard from a place where he had hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, all the paſſages that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened betwixt <hi>Sunamire</hi> and <hi>Tachmas:</hi> he had confidence enough to tell her of it, and to offer his ſervice to her in her Revenge. <hi>Sunamire</hi> could not deny what he ſaid to be true, and accepts of his offers. <hi>Metardaout</hi> told her, He would acquaint <hi>Allagolikan</hi> with all, whom he knew to be an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable Enemy to the Prince. <hi>Allagolikan</hi> was extream glad to hear that <hi>Sunamire</hi> would joyn in the Plot to ruine <hi>Tachmas.</hi> He ſends the Eunuch to acquaint her with a Project to that purpoſe: but
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40648:48"/>as <hi>Negara</hi> was not to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as well as <hi>Tachmas</hi> (for ſhe hated her to the death), ſhe would give no Ear to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. <hi>Allagolikan</hi> willing to make uſe of this occaſion; and being fearful that <hi>Sunamire</hi> would not continue her hatred long, was very angry with <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardaout;</hi> and ſaid, He had not given her a right information: and had much ado to forbear run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into the inner part of the Palace to ſpeak to her himſelf; but knowing that all his favour would not protect him againſt the <hi>Sophies</hi> Rage, if he ſhould tranſgreſs againſt his Orders; and that the going into that place was death to all others
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40648:48"/>but to the Princes of the Blood, contented himſelf to ſend <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardaout</hi> once more to tell her, That the courſe he intended to ſtear, was the ready way for deſtroying <hi>Negara</hi> as well as <hi>Tachmas:</hi> and the only means to draw her into the ſnare, was by making her believe that <hi>Tachmas</hi> was falſe to her. <hi>Sunamire</hi> having heard the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the Eunuch gave, conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to joyn with <hi>Allagolikan</hi> in this Plot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Metardaout,</hi> the better to bring the Princeſs to his bent, hearing her one day ſteal a ſigh: told her in the Ear, That ſhe ought not to laviſh away ſo many Tears to lament the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40648:49"/>loſs of an inconſtant Lover; and that Prince <hi>Tachmas,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her deſigned for the <hi>Sophy,</hi> had turned all his Thoughts and Vows towards <hi>Sunamire.</hi> Jealouſie is a ſtrange paſſion; and it muſt be allowed, That when it infuſes its poiſon into a Soul, it makes it produce moſt diſmal Effects. Reaſon to no purpoſe tells <hi>Negara,</hi> That ſince the Prince could be no more hers, it was juſt he ſhould look out for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſince if he ſhould remain indifferent, it would give new Allarms to the <hi>Sophy.</hi> She could not endure that another ſhould enjoy a Heart ſhe could not poſſeſs. This information
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40648:49"/>ſtruck her to the Heart: and ſhe thought it the more likely, becauſe ſhe knew that <hi>Tachmas,</hi> who heretofore delighted to be in <hi>Sunamire</hi>'s Company, begun of late to renew his Viſits to her with more Aſſiduity than ever.</p>
            <p>This wicked Maid came the next day into <hi>Negara</hi>'s Chamber, who feeling her paſſion, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the preſence of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that was ſo odious to her, could not forbear telling her, That ſhe was very happy to be Miſtreſs of Prince <hi>Tachmas</hi>'s Affections. <hi>Sunamire</hi> replyes, That ſhe ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at that, ſince ſhe no longer could pretend an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40648:50"/>in him, being ſhe muſt now live for <hi>Seliman</hi> alone. She utter'd theſe words with a forced malicious ſmile, and goes preſently out of <hi>Negara</hi>'s Chamber.</p>
            <p>The unfortunate Princeſs, could no longer doubt of her Lovers infidelity, and begun to repent to have ſaved that life, which ſhe never believed he would have made uſe of to her prejudice. Some time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, an Eunuch one of <hi>Allagoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan</hi>'s and <hi>Metardaout</hi>'s Creatures came into her Chamber with a paper in his hand. <hi>Negara</hi> deſiring to know what he meant by that paper: He told her, He was looking for <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namire,</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:40648:50"/>to give it her from Prince <hi>Tachmas.</hi> The Princeſs prays him to ſhew it her, which he refuſing to do, that ſhe might ſuſpect nothing; ſhe ſnatched it out of his hand, and ſuddenly ſhuts her ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Cloſet to ſee what was in it. It is eaſie to gueſs how unpleaſant the Contents of that Note was to her, which was as follows:</p>

            <p>There was a thouſand things that might make <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara</hi> doubt of the truth of this Writing; and ſhe might eaſily judg, that the Prince had too much prudence to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40648:51"/>commit ſuch an important and dangerous Deſign to a frail paper, and the faith of an Eunuch, though his Virtue had not retained him from it. But ſhe was too much blinded with her Jealouſie, to open her Eyes to ſuch Conſiderations. She followed all the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of this Venomous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Therefore to break the Prince's Deſign, and hinder her Rival from the enjoyment of a good ſhe thought due to her ſelf: She ſent to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe <hi>Seliman,</hi> That ſhe had ſomething of high Importance to communicate to him.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he came, ſhe ſhewed him this Note: <hi>Seli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:40648:52"/>at the ſight of it was tranſported with Rage; He commands <hi>Sunamire,</hi> whom the Princeſs would charge with part of this Accuſation, to be called before him. He reads this Note to her. But this cunning Slave confeſſed it was true, That <hi>Tachmas</hi> had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her with his bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions againſt the <hi>Sophy;</hi> but loudly proteſted, That ſhe always had reſiſted them, as might appear by the Note it ſelf, which if the Eunuch had brought to her, ſhe would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately have given the King notice of it. So that <hi>Seliman,</hi> that ſtill hated his Brother, and would be ſorry to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40648:52"/>turned all his Fury againſt him. He leaves the Note with <hi>Negara,</hi> that it might help totally to ſubdue her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, if there yet remained any parts of it unſmothered: and goes away with Terror and Fury in his Countenance.</p>
            <p>He ſent for <hi>Allagolikan,</hi> and tells him what he had learnt: the Favourite ſeeming to be much ſurprized, ſaid, He muſt blame his own lenity in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Brother. Upon which <hi>Seliman</hi> ſwears the ſecond Crime ſhould not go unpuniſhed, as the other had done.</p>
            <p>In the mean ſpace, <hi>Tachmas</hi> being ignorant of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy that was formed againſt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40648:53"/>him; but very well knowing <hi>Allagolikan</hi>'s nature, and not doubting but that <hi>Sunamire</hi> provoked by his laſt words, would plot ſome ill Deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Negara</hi> and himſelf; thought fit to give her a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution againſt <hi>Sunamire</hi>'s plots. He ſent to her the ſame Eunuch that diſcover'd to him the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites hatred: The Eunuch comes into <hi>Negara</hi>'s Chamber, a moment after <hi>Seliman</hi> left it. He drew her aſide, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly ſlipped a paper into her hand, which he told her, <hi>Tach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> had commanded him to bring her. <hi>Negara</hi> preſently ſteps into her Cloſet, all her thoughts were diſcompos'd:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40648:53"/>and going to read the Note, ſhe felt her Curioſity power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully oppoſed by a ſecret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, and Cruel apprehenſions of finding in it the Sentence of his Death. She had ſcarce opened it, when ſhe prenſently found it writ by the Prince's own hand, and in his own uſual Character: She draws out of her pocket that Note ſhe had ſhewed to <hi>Seliman;</hi> and having compared them together, ſhe found ſo much difference betwixt the writing of the one and the other, that ſhe could no longer doubt of the Cheat; but ſhe was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther convinced when ſhe read theſe words:</p>

            <p>The Princeſs had ſcarce ended reading this Note, but ſhe ſwooned away, all her ſenſes having left her: a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Horror had frozen up her Heart: Her Face was Vailed with the pale ſhades of Death; and her Eyes wanted even Tears, to ſhew they yet had any life left. She lay a long while in this inſenſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and it was the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt ſtate that ſhe ever after ſaw, during the reſt of her life. When ſhe had recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſenſe enough to feel her ſorrow, ſhe made ſeveral vain efforts to call out: but her voice remained ſtill intercluded and ſtifled by the violence
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40648:55"/>of her grief. Her imagination was clouded with ſad and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying Objects: She fancied <hi>Tachmas</hi>'s Ghoſt all bathed in blood, comes to Reproach her with his Death, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal effects of her blind and ill-grounded Jealouſie. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns into her Chamber, and with a Voice interrupted with Sighs, ſhe prays the Eunuch that brought her the Note to, run to the <hi>Sophy,</hi> and to tell him that ſhe had ſomething to acquaint him with of no leſs Conſequence than what ſhe had already told him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seliman</hi> returns to <hi>Negara;</hi> but as ſoon as he perceived ſhe intended to juſtifie the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40648:55"/>Prince, he attributes this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated change to her Love, and would not hear her; but ſaid abruptly as he was going out, That though <hi>Tachmas</hi> had not been guilty, theſe apparent Signs of a paſſionate affection towards him, were cauſe enough to ruine him. He commands the Eunuchs not to let her come out of her Chamber, nor the Princeſs <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gona,</hi> who was then juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd. He cauſed <hi>Tachmas</hi> to be clapped in a dark Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and left <hi>Allagolikan</hi> to ſee it done.</p>
            <p>The Prince not knowing what his Accuſation was, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all was the Favourites
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40648:56"/>contrivance, and therefore gave him ſome reproachful hints of it: But this Traytor inſolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwers him, That he only executed the <hi>Sophie</hi>'s Orders: to whom he returns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seliman</hi> calls for ſome of his Council, to adviſe with them what was to be done with <hi>Tachmas. Allagolikan,</hi> who ſpoke firſt, opined his Death; Some were of the ſame opinion: but others, with ſo much force and Eloquence repreſented to the <hi>Sophy</hi> the danger of putting the Prince to Death; That it was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to keep him in ſafe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody. It was carried in ſpight of all the Favourite's Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40648:56"/>that <hi>Tachmas</hi> ſhould live. But <hi>Seliman</hi> would have a Corporal puniſhment inflicted upon him: And as he was conſidering of the kind, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagolikan</hi> propoſes to have his Eyes pluck'd out: Alledging, That as by the ſight of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara,</hi> he became the King's Rival, ſo this was the beſt Expedient to Revenge both his Love and his Throne; and to take away from <hi>Tach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> all means of attempting for ever any thing againſt the one or the other. Cruel <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman</hi> approves of this Advice. And this barbarous Sentence was pronounced againſt the unhappy Prince: And the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40648:57"/>had Order to ſee it put in Execution, the King himſelf refuſing to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, fearing leſt in ſeeing him, he ſhould be moved to pity, as before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Allagolikan</hi> being impatient, until he made <hi>Tachmas</hi> feel the effects of his Rage; comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Stage to be erected in the Hall, wherein this Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Blood was to be ſpilt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Then it was that this Prince, who under <hi>Sophy Chabas</hi> his Father, had carried the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of his Arms through all <hi>Aſia,</hi> and made the <hi>Ottomans</hi> tremble for fear of his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, even at the Gates of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40648:57"/>their <hi>Seraglio.</hi> This Prince that had a million of Souls at his Devotion, and whoſe Virtue as well as Power was cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all the Army: This Prince, in fine, for whom all his Souldiers would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken pride to ſhed the laſt drop of their bloods, ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf abandoned to the Fury of a Traytor, without finding one man that durſt attempt any thing in his Defence. So true it is, that Fortune rules the friendſhip of the major part of Mankind. Yet no degenerate Voice, no weak or baſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint falls from him: only when he deſired to know his Accuſation, and that it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40648:58"/>It was for conſpiring gainſt the King; He beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heaven quickly to make his Innocence appear, and not to leave ſo foul, and ſo black a Treaſon unpuniſhed.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Princeſs <hi>Negara</hi> delivered up her Soul to all the Cruel ſtroaks of an unconſolable grief; and the moſt pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Objects that can offer themſelves now to her Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, were thoſe of Deſpair. She heard from all hands, that <hi>Tachmas</hi> was in the hands of the Executioner; and there were ſome of the Eunuchs who by miſ-information, aſſured her that he loſt his life. Then
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40648:58"/>ſhe thought it time to have recourſe to the laſt Remedy, and put an end to her miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by Poiſon, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Princeſs <hi>Begona,</hi> who was there with her.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sophy</hi> being diſtracted with ſeveral Remorſes, thought to retire into the inner part of the Palace, that by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the Ladies he might diſſipate that black Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with which his Soul was agitated. He was ſcarce got within <hi>Negara</hi>'s Chamber, when he ſaw his Mother pale and ghoſtly; her Face all cover'd with the cold ſweats of Death: As he went to help her, turning his Face towards ſome
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40648:59"/>noiſe he had heard, he ſaw the unhappy Princeſs grovelling in the ſame ſtate with <hi>Bego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> and making her laſt Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, to diſpoſe of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moment of her life: ſhe expired, uttering with her dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breath the Name of <hi>Tach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame inſtant, <hi>Suna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire</hi> preſented her ſelf to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman,</hi> and aſſured him that <hi>Tachmas</hi> was Innocent; and that the Note which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, was contrived by <hi>Allagolikan,</hi> with whom ſhe had been of Intelligence: and that ſhe well knew what ſhe deſerved for ſuch a Treaſon; and with that, drew out a
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40648:59"/>Poiniard ſhe had under her Garments, and therewith ſtob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing her ſelf in the breaſt, fell down bathed in her own blood by <hi>Negara</hi>'s ſide. The <hi>Sophy</hi> ſent preſently to ſtop the Execution, but it was too late: for this Traytor was too eager to quench the thirſt of his inſatiate Revenge.</p>
            <p>The unfortunate <hi>Tachmas,</hi> having underſtood what befel in the inner part of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, wept with Tears of blood the loſs of his Mother and his Miſtreſs: and never did Love and Nature draw ſo many moving Complaints from any man before, as <hi>Tachmas</hi> utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this fatal Occaſion.</p>
            <pb n="110" facs="tcp:40648:60"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Seliman,</hi> whoſe Jealouſie was now extinguiſhed by ſo many Tragical Events, fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a furious Rage againſt <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagolikan;</hi> He cauſed him to be ſtrangled before his Face, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by making this Traytor at his turn to ſuffer the juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all his Crimes.</p>
